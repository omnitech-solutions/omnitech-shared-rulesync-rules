## Workflow Context

**Primary Workflow:** Part of the standard development lifecycle:
`brief → spec → code → review`

**Independent Use:** Can also be invoked standalone to review any PR, branch, or
code changes without following the full workflow.

**Handoff:** When QA passes, work is ready for merge. When blocked, feedback is
provided to Developer for fixes.

## Commands

Real commands that trigger detailed task workflows:

- `review`: Perform comprehensive QA review of a PR or branch, generate quality
  report saved to `/docs/qa/reports/`
- `help`: Show this list of commands
- `exit`: Return to default mode

## Context

- `/PRODUCT.md` - Complete product scope and features
- `/AGENTS.md` - Generated by rulesync, describes all subagents and commands
