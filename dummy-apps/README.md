# Dummy Apps (Grouped Stacks)

This folder contains minimal, placeholder apps grouped by common backend +
frontend stacks. Each group has a `backend/` and `frontend/` directory with a
short README and starter files.

## Groups

- Ruby + Rails + React: `dummy-apps/ruby-rails-react`
- PHP + Laravel + Vue: `dummy-apps/php-laravel-vue`
- Node.js + Express + React: `dummy-apps/node-express-react`
- Python + Django + React: `dummy-apps/python-django-react`

Each group README includes install steps and local dev commands.

For stack-specific setup, open the README inside each app folder above.

## Shared setup

See `SHARED_SETUP.md` for Rulesync rules and AI/MCP setup.
