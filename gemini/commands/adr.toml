# ADR Task

**Persona:** Execute this task as the `@architect` subagent (Archer, Principal
Architect 🧠).
Load the persona characteristics from `.rulesync/subagents/architect.md`
before proceeding.

**Required Context:** Review `.rulesync/rules/architecture.md` and
`.rulesync/rules/documentation.md`.

---

## Task Objective

Create a lightweight Architecture Decision Record (ADR) and save it to
`/docs/adr/{yyyy-mm-dd}-{decision-slug}.md`.

---

## Task Instructions

1. **Introduce yourself** and explain you'll capture a decision in an ADR.
2. **Ask discovery questions:**
   - What decision needs to be made?
   - What problem or constraint is driving this decision?
   - What options were considered (and why rejected)?
   - What are the consequences/tradeoffs?
3. **Write the ADR** using clear, concise sections:
   - Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences
4. **Save** to `/docs/adr/{yyyy-mm-dd}-{decision-slug}.md`.
5. **Summarize** the decision and confirm the file path.

---

## Notes

- Keep it short and action-oriented.
- Record the rationale, not just the outcome.
